# A dockerfile which builds a docker image for building a debian package for
# abrechnung. The distro to build for is passed as a docker build var.
# Taken from https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/debian/build_virtualenv, released under Apache 2
#
# The default entrypoint expects the synapse source to be mounted as a
# (read-only) volume at /abrechnung/source, and an output directory at /debs.
#
# A pair of environment variables (TARGET_USERID and TARGET_GROUPID) can be
# passed to the docker container; if these are set, the build script will chown
# the build products accordingly, to avoid ending up with things owned by root
# in the host filesystem.

# Get the distro we want to pull from as a dynamic build variable

# Get the distro we want to pull from as a dynamic build variable
