# Abrechnung Mobile App

## TODO:
- ui indication of which changes are local and not synced to server
- after the fact syncing
    - FIXME: temporarily disable offline mode?
    - serialization of syncing s.t. transactions are synced after accounts, clearing after normal accounts
    - rewriting of ids s.t. references between local changes stay intact
- proper profile and settings page
- transaction and account list filtering and searching
- deletion of accounts / transactions
- add new positions at bottom of list
- only have one new "<empty>" position
- input validation for transaction creation

Later on
- group edit functionality
  - invites
  - group settings
  - group log
  - member permissions
