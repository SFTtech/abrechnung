The *Abrechnung* (German for *reckoning*, *settlement*, *revenge*) aims to be a versatile and user-centric **payment**, **transaction** and **bookkeeping** management tool for human groups and events.

>>> You can simply **try** our [**demo instance**](https://demo.abrechnung.sft.lol)!


Abrechnung is a tool to track *money*, *purchases* (and its items) and *debtors* for:

Group life | Events | Travelling
-|-|-
Flat share roommates | Cooking revelries | Holiday trips
Your Hackerspace | LAN parties | Business trips
Family life | Regular parties | Adventures
... | ... | ...


---

All this is possible through the **basic blocks**:

* Purchase & transaction tracking
* Accounts with balance compensation
* Invoice handling + optional position specification
* Assignment (by fractions or counts) of positions and invoices
* Clearing accounts for merging transactions
* Multitenant access
