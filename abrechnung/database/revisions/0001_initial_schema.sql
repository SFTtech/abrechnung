-- group data, the real purpose of the abrechnung
--
-- all items of group data are organized in two tables:
-- the base table, and the history table which has the name of the base table
-- plus an appended '_history'.
-- the base table contains - for each item, deleted or not - one row with
-- all information that is fixed for all time:
-- - the item id
-- - the group id
-- - other associated ids
-- the history table can contain multiple entries for each item.
-- each history table entry is linked to a change id,
-- and contains all information that can change over time:
-- - whether the item is valid (this is set to false in changes that delete it)
--   often there's conditions for when valid is allowed to be set to false.
-- - item-specific information, e.g. name, price, currency, ...
